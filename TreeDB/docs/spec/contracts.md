# TreeDB Behavioral Contracts

This document specifies externally-observable behavior expected by callers.

## 1. Key Model

- Keys are byte slices.
- Key order is lexicographic (`bytes.Compare` semantics).
- The tree is ordered and range-addressable.

## 2. Read Contracts

### 2.1 `Get`

- `Get(key)` returns `(value, nil)` when key exists.
- `Get(key)` returns `(nil, nil)` when key is absent.
- Returned bytes are safe copies.

### 2.2 `GetUnsafe`

- Public `DB.GetUnsafe` currently aliases `Get` behavior (safe copy).
- Zero-copy reads are available through snapshot/iterator internals, not through this API.

### 2.3 `Has`

- `Has(key)` returns `(true, nil)` only for a visible non-deleted key.
- Deleted/missing keys return `(false, nil)`.

## 3. Write Contracts

### 3.1 Point ops

- `Set`, `Delete` are non-sync writes.
- `SetSync`, `DeleteSync` request sync durability boundary subject to durability mode.

### 3.2 Batches

- `NewBatch` accumulates operations.
- `Write` commits without strict sync guarantee.
- `WriteSync` commits with sync guarantee only in durable mode.

For WAL replay, commit-log batches are treated atomically at replay boundaries.

## 4. Range and Iterator Contracts

### 4.1 Ordering

- `Iterator(start, end)` yields ascending lexicographic keys.
- `ReverseIterator(start, end)` yields descending order over the same bound domain.

### 4.2 Bounds

- Range domain is half-open: `[start, end)`.
- `nil` start means unbounded lower bound.
- `nil` end means unbounded upper bound.
- If both bounds are non-nil and `start >= end`, iterator is immediately invalid.

### 4.3 Iterator lifetime

- Iterators are point-in-time views.
- `Key()`/`Value()` data is valid until next movement/close.
- `KeyCopy`/`ValueCopy` provide stable copies.
- Iterator must be closed.

## 5. Snapshot Contracts

- Snapshot captures a stable commit sequence.
- Snapshot pins index generation and value-log segment set needed for reads.
- Snapshot must be closed to release retention pressure.

## 6. Concurrency and Locking

### 6.1 Process-level locking

- Read-write open acquires exclusive directory lock.
- Concurrent read-write opens on same DB directory are not allowed.

### 6.2 In-process concurrency

- Effective model is single-writer / multi-reader.
- Concurrent writers are serialized.
- Readers can run concurrently with writer via snapshot semantics.

## 7. Durability Contract Summary

Durability mode controls guarantees for sync calls:

- `DurabilityDurable`:
  - `*Sync` methods use fsync durability boundaries.
- `DurabilityWALOnRelaxed`:
  - WAL remains on, but `*Sync` is relaxed (no fsync boundary).
- `DurabilityWALOffRelaxed`:
  - WAL off, relaxed sync; durability boundary is typically checkpoint-based.

Detailed semantics are in `TreeDB/docs/spec/write-path-and-durability.md`.

## 8. Read-only Open Contract

When opened read-only:

- write operations must fail,
- no mutating recovery steps run,
- no background maintenance mutates on-disk state.
