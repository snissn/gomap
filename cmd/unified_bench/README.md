# unified_bench

Side-by-side benchmarks for `HashDB`, `BTreeOnHashDB`, `TreeDB` (cached), Badger, and LevelDB.

## Run

- Build: `make unified-bench` (writes `bin/unified-bench`)
- Run: `./bin/unified-bench`
- Or: `go run ./cmd/unified_bench`

## Reproducibility

- Randomized tests use a per-test PRNG derived from `-seed` so every DB sees the same random key/query sequence.
- The chosen seed is printed to stderr at startup.

## Tests

- `write_seq` — Sequential Write
- `write_rand` — Random Write
- `batch_write` — Batch Write
- `batch_random` — Batch Random
- `batch_delete` — Batch Delete
- `delete_rand` — Random Delete
- `read_rand` — Random Read
- `full_scan` — Full Scan (iterate the full keyspace)
- `prefix_scan` — Prefix Scan (range scans over `[start,end)`)
  - Aliases: `scan` → `full_scan`, `range_scan` → `prefix_scan`

- `-treedb-bg-vacuum-span-ppm` TreeDB: background index vacuum span ratio threshold (ppm), `0`=default
- `-treedb-allow-unsafe` TreeDB: allow unsafe durability/integrity options (required for unsafe toggles)
- `-seed` PRNG seed for randomized tests (default 1; `0` = time-based)
- `-keep` keep temp DB directories after run
- `-settle-before-scans` close+reopen DBs before `full_scan`/`prefix_scan` to measure scan performance on a “settled” (fully flushed) state
- `-progress` live table updates to stderr (default true)
- `-format` output format: `table` or `markdown`
- `-cpuprofile` write per-test CPU profiles to `<prefix>_<test>_<db>.pprof`
- `-cpuprofile-tests` restrict CPU profiling to a CSV list of tests (e.g. `random_read,batch_random`)
- `-checkpoint-cpuprofile` write per-checkpoint CPU profiles to `<prefix>_checkpoint_<test>_<db>.pprof`
- `-checkpoint-cpuprofile-tests` restrict checkpoint CPU profiling to a CSV list of tests
- `-treedb-cache-stats-before-reads` print select `treedb.cache.*` stats before read/scan tests (treedb only)
- `-blockprofile`, `-mutexprofile`, `-trace` write profiling artifacts to files
- `-max-wall` abort the run if wall time exceeds this duration (guardrail; `0` = disabled)
- `-max-rss-mb` abort the run if RSS exceeds this many MiB (guardrail; `0` = disabled; Linux-only)
- `-checkpoint-between-tests` force a best-effort durability checkpoint between tests (DBs that support `Checkpoint()`)
- `-vacuum-between-tests` vacuum supported DBs between tests (implies `-checkpoint-between-tests`; TreeDB uses `VacuumIndexOnline`)
- `-checkpoint-every-ops` force a best-effort durability checkpoint every N ops during write-heavy tests (DBs that support `Checkpoint()`)
- `-checkpoint-every-bytes` force a best-effort durability checkpoint every N approx bytes during write-heavy tests (DBs that support `Checkpoint()`)
- `-suite` named suite:
  - `readme` — generates the README graphs + sweep tables
  - `churn` — churn + settled scans (`treedb,leveldb`)
  - `churnvacuum` — churn + settled scans, then index compaction and scan again
  - `flushdrain` — write burst → checkpoint boundary → read; prints checkpoint timing (TreeDB-focused). Use `-flushdrain-checkpoint-max=<duration>` to fail the suite if the checkpoint before `random_read` exceeds your latency target.
  - `flushthrash` — forces a small TreeDB flush threshold; catches flush thrash / runaway backlog regressions
  - `bigkeys_guard` — small TreeDB flush threshold + large keycount, with wall/RSS caps for CI guardrails
  - `longmix` — long-ish mixed workload + settle boundary with fragmentation reports
  - `sload_readheavy` — settled point reads with value-log pointers + forkchoice-style batch commits
  - `maintenance_budget` — sweep TreeDB maintenance K values; reports checkpoint time vs index size, recommends K
- `-outdir` output directory for suite artifacts (plots/images; used by `-suite readme`)

## Notes

TreeDB is a cached engine (memtable + background flush). If you run long write-heavy phases and then measure `random_read`/scans immediately, the results can be dominated by background flush work (“flush debt”).

Recommended:

- For *settled read/scan performance*: use `-checkpoint-between-tests` or `-settle-before-scans`.
- For *mixed workload under flush debt*: keep defaults and optionally enable `-treedb-cache-stats-before-reads` to see queue/backlog stats.

### Repro: mixed vs settled reads (TreeDB)

Mixed (reads under flush debt; intentionally stressful):

```bash
go run ./cmd/unified_bench -dbs treedb -profile fast -keys 900000 -valsize 128 -batchsize 1000 \\
  -test sequential_write,random_write,dataset_write_random,dataset_write_sorted,batch_write,batch_random,batch_delete,batch_small_seq,random_delete,random_read \\
  -treedb-cache-stats-before-reads -progress=false
```

Settled (reads after a durability boundary):

```bash
go run ./cmd/unified_bench -dbs treedb -profile fast -keys 900000 -valsize 128 -batchsize 1000 \\
  -test sequential_write,random_write,dataset_write_random,dataset_write_sorted,batch_write,batch_random,batch_delete,batch_small_seq,random_delete,random_read \\
  -checkpoint-between-tests -progress=false
```
